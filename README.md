Front-End And Back-End Developer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js , Node.js , Express.js and MongoDb)

Hi everyone! I'm [Atif Khan], a passionate front-end and backend developer currently honing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js , Node.js , Express.js and MongoDb. I'm eager to explore the exciting world of these technologies and build interactive user interfaces.

This GitHub profile is my playground for practicing and sharing my learnings, but it's also a space where I hope to contribute to the community.  I've already shared JavaScript Basic Coding Question repository and HTML/CSS projects that you might find helpful.

In addition, expect to find more practice problems, projects, and code snippets related to front-end development, with a particular focus on honing my React.js skills as I progress.

Feel free to reach out and connect! I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and learning from other front-end developers.
